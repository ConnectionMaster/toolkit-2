# DevBots Toolkit
_Stefan Arentz, October 2020_

This project is similar to [github.com/actions/toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit) - it contains a mix of utility functions and helpers for writing GitHub Actions related to development on Apple's platforms.

All the DevBots code is work in progress but slowly reaching a stable 1.0 point. Look in the individual packages for documentation for now.
